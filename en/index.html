				Welcome to Natural language and Text Processing Laboratory of Iran University of Science and Technology!
				<br/>
				Scince computer science was born, human have had the dream to create a device which can interact with; A device that can listen to human's commands or questions, and reply to them properly. Therefore, natural language processing is one of main subfields in artificial inteligence and also in linguistics and its goal is computerizing process of cognition and conceptualization of a natural language. More precisely, NLP is using of computer for text and speech processing for a language. Despite of many endevours those are performed by researchers in Iran and other countries in Farsi language, there is a large gap in NLP in Farsi rather than other language (for example English).
				<br/>
				This laboratory has been established in January of 2013 to help to proceed of NLP for Farsi language. All of software have place in this website, have been published under 3rd version of GNU licence. Therefore other researchers can use the codes freely in their projects.
				<br/>
				Major research topics in IUST NLP group includes:
